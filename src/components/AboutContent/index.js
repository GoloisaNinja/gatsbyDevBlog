        <span> What</span> I do and <span>what</span> I do it with.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I love to build things. Useful things, and not-so-useful things. I like
        building amazing things for amazing people and amazing companies. I've
        been programming with JavaScript since 2017 when I set out to become a
        Full Stack Developer.
        <br />
        <br />I made a career change from finance to the tech sector, because
        that was where my heart was. I started with Vanilla JavaScript and tried
        to learn the fundamentals. Then I pivoted to libraries and frameworks,
        like React and Gatsby. I really enjoy working with the various tools to
        bootstrap a project quickly and then scale it for larger datasets,
        users, etc. After making smaller static projects, I really wanted to
        tackle applications that would, in my mind, be far more interactive,
        fun, progressive, and dynmaic.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's when I started learning backend technologies like NodeJS,
        Express, Mongoose, Firestore, and MongoDB. I quickly fell in love with
        the MERN stack and was amazed at how flexible JavaScript could be. Of
        late, I have been enjoying working with various headless CMS options
        like Strapi and Shopify. The tools are ever changing, but it is a lot
        fun trying to keep up!

        Maybe we could work together? If you got here independently and didn't
        come from my portfolio page, be sure to head over there and check out
        some cool projects I built. There is also a contact form where you can
        get in touch with me.

      <h3>
        <span> Why</span> I started this <span>developer</span> blog.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I could tell you that I am an accomplished writer and that this blog
        serves a very important function of putting my, very well thought out,
        ideas out into the interwebs. But, that would be a lie. If anything, my
        hope is that this blog will help me develop, and nurture my writing
        skills. As a developer, having facility with languages, understanding
        complex syntax, and being able to organize abstract structures are all
        really important. But just as important are the "soft skills", like
        communication.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'll do my best to try and cover a wide range of topics and to also post
        as regularly as I can. I also think there will be value (not just in my
        crazy ideas/theories) in documenting my (mis) adventures as I learn new
        technologies, develop new projects and applications, and just generally
        make my way through the new career path I've set myself on. I can't
        guarantee the content will be riveting, or that I will keep you coming
        back with great tech tips and walkthoughs. But I can promise I'll give
        it my best shot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, I built this blog because I very much wanted to play around
        with a static site generator like Gatsby, while using a decoupled CMS
        like Strapi. The idea was to create a project that would showcase the
        strengths and speed of Gatsby (fast project startup/scalablity) with the
        power of a content managment system. A blog works very well for this. I
        was able to design the frontend using my own frameworks, libraries,
        design aesthetics and templating. Meanwhile, I can simply inject
        markdown "articles" into my decoupled CMS on the backend. A few magical
        webhooks later, and content is posted and templated. It's been a fun
        project to create, and I was astonished at how quickly I was able to get
        it all off the ground.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of the day, I feel a good developer is one that is always
        learning. And it is my goal and my hope that you and I can tackle this
        learning journey <span>together</span>.

        I need to quickly apologise (with an "s") to my wonderful, amazing wife
        Lou Lou. I used "Jon" a lot on this page and my wife hates that{" "}
        <span role="img" aria-label="laughing emoji">
          ðŸ¤£
        </span>{" "}
        - fun fact: my wife refuses to call me Jon and has called me Jack since
        the day we met
